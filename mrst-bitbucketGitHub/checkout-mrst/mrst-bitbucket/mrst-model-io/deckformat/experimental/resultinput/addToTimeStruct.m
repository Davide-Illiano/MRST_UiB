function mt_struct = addToTimeStruct(mt_struct, t_struct)
%Append single time step report structure to cumulative report structure
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   allsteps = addToTimeStruct(allsteps, step)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   allsteps - Report structure for all existing time steps.
%
%   step     - Report structure for a single time step.  Typically the
%              output of function 'wellCalculateProduction'.
%
% RETURNS:
%   allsteps - Report structure for all existing time steps, with 'step'
%              data appended (by means of HORZCAT).
%
% NOTE:
%   Any structure fields which exist in 'step' but not in the input
%   'allsteps' will be created in the output 'allsteps'.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `wellCalculateProduction`, `horzcat`.
