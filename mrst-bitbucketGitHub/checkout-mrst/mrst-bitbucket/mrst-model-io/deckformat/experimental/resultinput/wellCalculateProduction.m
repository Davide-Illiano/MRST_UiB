function report = wellCalculateProduction(state, W, fluid, time)
%Convert MRST well solution data to ECLIPSE keyword representation.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   report = wellCalculateProduction(rSol, wSol, W, fluid, time)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   rSol  - Reservoir solution structure as defined by a flow and/or a
%           transport solver routine
%
%   wSol  - Well solution data structure.
%
%   W     - Well data structure as defined by function 'addWell'.
%           Report data will be generated for each well in 'W'.
%
%   fluid - Fluid data structure.
%
%   time  - Report time.
%
% RETURNS:
%   report - ECLIPSE keyword representation of the well solution data.
%            A structure array containing the following fields:
%              - TIME -- Report time (== time).
%              - WBHP -- Bottom-hole pressure in each well at TIME.
%              - WVPT -- Total rate (sum of all perforation fluxes).
%              - WOPR -- Total oil production.
%              - WWPR -- Total water production.
%              - WWCT -- Well water-cut.
%
% NOTE:
%   Multiple 'report' structures--e.g., from several time steps--may be
%   concatenated using the 'addToTimeStruct' function.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `incompTPFA`, `explicitTransport`, `addWell`, `addToTimeStruct`.
