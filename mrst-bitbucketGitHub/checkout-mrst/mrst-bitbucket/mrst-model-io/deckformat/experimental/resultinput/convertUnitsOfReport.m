function report = convertUnitsOfReport(report, metric)
%Convert report object to standard metric units
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   report = convertUnitsOfReport(report, metric)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   report - Report data structure, as defined by function
%            'addToTimeStruct' for all time steps of a simulation run.
%            Assumed to contain the fields 'TIME', 'WBHP', 'WVPT', 'WOPR',
%            and 'WWPR'.
%
%   metric - Logical value indicating whether or not the output report
%            values should be given in metric or field units.  Typically
%            corresponds to 'grdecl.METRIC'.
%
%            The metric units are
%                - Pressure -> bar (barsa)
%                - Time     -> days
%                - Rate     -> meter^3 / day
%
%            The field units are
%                - Pressure -> psi (psia)
%                - Time     -> days
%                - Rate     -> stb / day
%
% RETURNS:
%   report - Report data structure whose values have been converted as per
%            the caller's request.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `wellCalculateProduction`, `addToTimeStruct`.
