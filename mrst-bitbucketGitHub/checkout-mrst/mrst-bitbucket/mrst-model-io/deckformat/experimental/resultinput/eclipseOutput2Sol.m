function refSol = eclipseOutput2Sol(G, output, active)
%Convert ECLIPSE output to MRST rSol object.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   refSol = eclipseOutput2Sol(G, output, active)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G      - Grid data structure.  Must contain valid field
%            'G.cells.indexMap'.
%
%   output - ECLIPSE output structure as defined by function
%            'readEclipseOutput'.
%
%   active - List of explicitly active cells.  These are the global (i.e.,
%            linearised Cartesian) cells for which ACTNUM==1 and, if
%            applicable, PORO>0.
%            Logical array of size PROD(G.cartDims)-by-1, the TRUE elements
%            of which correspond to the explicitly active cells.
%
% RETURNS:
%   refSol - Reference solution as an MRST rSol-type object/structure.
