function varargout = reordersequence(G, flux)
%Compute topological sorted strong components of outflow graph (G, flux)
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   s      = reordersequence(G, flux);
%   [s, b] = reordersequence(G, flux);
%
% Together, the grid G and the face fluxes form a directed graph, where the
% cells a vertices and directed edges exist from vertex i to vertex j if
% there is a positive flux from cell i to cell j.  This graph may be termed
% the outflow graph, and its adjacency matrix is the inflow matrix.
%
% The function REORDERSEQUENCE returns a topological sorted sequence of
% strong components of the inflow graph computed using Tarjans algorithm.
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G    - Grid structure.  Geometric primitives are not needed by this
%          function.
%   flux - Vector of face fluxes.
%
% RETURNS:
%   s    - vector of cell numbers.
%
%   b    - vector of positions for strong components: the i'th strong
%          component consists of the cells s(b(i):b(i+1)-1),
%          numel(b) = #(strong components) + 1
%
% EXAMPLE:
%   % Make a 3-by-2 grid, reordersequence needs no geometry...
%      G = cartGrid([3, 2]);
%
%   % make fake flux field
%      flux = ones(17, 1);
%      flux(6)  = -1;
%      flux(12) = -1;
%
%   % Plot the grid in 3D-view.
%      [s, b] = reordersequence(G, flux);
