function wdp = impesTPFADefaultWellModel(state, wells, fluid)
%Default well pressure model for impesTPFA solver
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   wdp = impesTPFADefaultWellModel(state, wells, fluid)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   state - Reservoir and well solution structure.
%
%   wells - Well data structure as defined by function 'addWell'.
%
%   fluid - Fluid data structure as defined by function 'initEclipseFluid'
%           or similar.
%
% RETURNS:
%   wdp - Well perforation gravity pressure adjusments.  One scalar value
%         for each perforation in each well.  Specifically, the pressure
%         difference (p_w + wdp - pc) may be inserted directly into
%         Peaceman's connection flux model.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `impesTPFA`.
