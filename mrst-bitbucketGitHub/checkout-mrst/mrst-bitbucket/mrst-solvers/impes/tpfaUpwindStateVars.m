%Compute upwind mobilities and component volumes
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [fmob, fz, dfmob] = ...
%     tpfaUpwindStateVars(G, press, z, rho, cmob, dcmob, bc, wells, OP)
%
%   [fmob, fz, dfmob, Af] = ...
%     tpfaUpwindStateVars(G, press, z, rho, cmob, dcmob, bc, wells, OP, Ac)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G  - Grid structure.
%
%   press -
%        Cell pressure.  One (positive) scalar value for each cell in the
%        grid 'G'.
%
%   z  - Component volume densities at surface conditions.  One
%        non-negative value for each fluid component in each cell in the
%        grid 'G'.
%
%   rho -
%        Phase densities.  One positive scalar value for each fluid phase
%        (at reservoir conditions) for each cell in the grid 'G'.
%
%   cmob -
%        Phase mobilities.  One non-negative scalar value for fluid phase
%        (at reservoir conditions) for each cell in the grid 'G'.
%
%   dcmob -
%        Phase mobility derivatives (wrt. saturation).  One scalar value
%        for each fluid phase (at reservoir conditions) differentiated with
%        respect to each phase saturation (at reservoir conditions) for
%        each cell in the grid 'G'.
%
%   bc - Boundary condition structure as defined by function 'addBC'.  If
%        ISEMPTY(bc), the upwind calculation will assume no-flow boundary
%        conditions on all boundary faces.
%
%   wells -
%        Well data structure as defined by function 'addWell'.  Specify an
%        empty array (e.g., wells=[]) if the simulation model does not
%        include well perforations.
%
%   OP - TPFA connection operators as defined by function
%        'tpfaConnectionOperators'.  This operator must be consistent with
%        the values of 'bc' and 'wells'.
%
%   Ac - Fluid composition matrix per cell.  Transforms saturations at
%        reservoir conditions to surface volumes per pore volume at
%        surface conditions.  Mathematically, Ac=Rc*inv(Bc).  OPTIONAL.
%        Only needed if computing upwind composition matrices per
%        interface.
%
% RETURNS:
%   fmob -
%        Upwind phase mobilities.  One non-negative scalar value for each
%        fluid phase (at reservoir conditions) for each connection (i.e.,
%        grid face and, possibly, well perforation) defined in the
%        simulation model specified by (G,bc,wells).
%
%   fz - Upwind component volume densities.  One non-negative scalar value
%        for fluid component (at surface conditions) for each connection
%        defined in the simulation model specified by (G,bc,wells).
%
%   dfmob -
%        Upwind phase mobility derivatives.  One scalar value for each
%        fluid phase (at reservoir conditions) differentiated with respect
%        to each phase saturation (at reservoir conditions) for each
%        connection defined in the simulation model specified by the
%        (G,bc,wells) tuple.
%
%   Af - Upwind fluid composition matrix per interface.  Mathematically,
%        Af=Rf*inv(Bf).  OPTIONAL.  Only computed if specifically requested
%        *and* if the caller supplies input values 'Ac'.  If requested and
%        no input values are present, an error condition occurs.
%
% NOTE:
%   The upwind values are simply taken from the appropriate cell values by
%   considering differences in hydraulic head for each fluid phase (at
%   reservoir conditions).
