function N = tpfaExtendedConnections(G, bc, wells)
%Form extended connection (neighbourship) definition by wells and BCs.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   N = tpfaExtendedConnections(G, bc, wells)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G  - Grid structure.
%
%   bc - Boundary condition structure as defined by function addBC.  If
%        ISEMPTY(bc), then no additional connections will be formed or
%        enumerated for boundary conditions.
%
%   wells -
%        Well data structure as defined by function 'addWell'.  If
%        ISEMPTY(wells), the no additional connections will be formed or
%        enumerated for wells.
%
% RETURNS:
%   N - Connection (neighbourship) definition corresponding to
%       G.faces.neighbors, possibly extended by boundary conditions and/or
%       well perforations.
