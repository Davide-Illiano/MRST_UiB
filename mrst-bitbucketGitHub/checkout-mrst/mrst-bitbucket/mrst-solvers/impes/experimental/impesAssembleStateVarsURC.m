function [p, z, fp, s] = impesAssembleStateVarsURC(state, bc, wells, wdp)
%Collect pressure and surface volumes into linear arrays
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [p, z, fp] = impesAssembleStateVars(state, bc, wells, wdp)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   state - Reservoir and well solution structure.
%
%   bc    - Boundary condition data structure as defined by function
%           'addBC'.  If ISEMPTY(bc), then the face mobility on outer faces
%           will be that of the connecting cell.  Otherwise, the mobility
%           is taken from the boundary condition if it is an in-flow
%           condition and from the cell if it is an out-flow interface.
%
%   wells - Well data structure as defined by function 'addWell'.  If
%           ISEMPTY(wells), then no additional phase mobility will be
%           defined.  Otherwise the same provisions apply to 'wells' as to
%           the boundary condition structure 'bc'.
%
%   wdp   - Perforation gravity pressure adjustments.  This is the result
%           of modelling the behaviour of the free-stream flow within the
%           well track in the presence or absence of gravity effects.
%
%           Function 'impesTPFADefaultWellModel' is a simplified well model
%           that may be used to compute such values, but more advanced
%           approaches may be employed too.
