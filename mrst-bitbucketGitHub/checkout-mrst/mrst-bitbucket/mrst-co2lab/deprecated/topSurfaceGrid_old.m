function [g_top, g] = topSurfaceGrid(g, varargin)
%Make a hybrid grid of the top surface of a 3D grid having a logical
%ijk-index (e.g., a corner-point grid or a logically Cartesian grid)
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [Gt,G] = topSurfaceGrid(G)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G       - 3D grid as described by grid_structure.
%
%  'pn'/pv - List of 'key'/value pairs defining optional parameters.  The
%            supported options are:
%              'Verbose' -- boolean, whether to show log messages or not.
%                           Default value: mrstVerbose
%              'AddFaults' -- boolean indicating if faults should be added
%                             to the resulting 2D model.
%
% RETURNS:
%   Gt - structure representing the top-surface grid. The structure
%      consists of two parts:
%
%      (i) the surface projected onto the xy-plane represented as a
%          standard 2D grid that follows the standard grid conventions as
%          outlined in grid_structure,
%
%      (ii) a set of extra fields that represent the surface elevation, the
%          3D surface normals, the elevation of the bottom surface, the
%          height of the surface, the columns of volumetric cells attached
%          to each cell (quadrilateral patch) in the 2D grid, etc.
%
%      Altogether, the hybrid grid structure contains the following fields:
%
%      - cells   -- A structure specifying properties for each individual
%                   cell in the grid. See CELLS below for details.
%
%      - faces   -- A structure specifying properties for each individual
%                   face in the grid. See FACES below for details.
%
%      - nodes   -- A structure specifying properties for each individual
%                   node (vertex) in the grid. See NODES below for details.
%
%      - columns -- A structure specifying properties of each individual
%                   vertically-averaged column. See COLUMNS below for
%                   details.
%
%      - type    -- A cell array of strings describing the history of grid
%                   constructor and modifier functions through which this
%                   particular grid has been defined.
%
%   G -  3D grid with connected columns and no disconnected cells,
%      corresponding to Gt. Important to use this 3D grid when doing
%      comparisons or if 2D data is mapped back to 3D grid.
%
%
% FIELDS in a 2D top-surface grid:
%
%   COLUMNS - Cell structure Gt.columns that represents the column of
%   cells in the 3D grid that are attached to each cell in the top-surface
%   grid. Containts the fields:
%
%     - cells  -- A G.cells.num-by-1 array of cell indices from the
%                 3D grid, which together with Gt.cells.columnPos
%                 define the columns attached to the top surface.
%
%     - dz     -- A G.cells.num-by-1 array of heights of the cells in the
%                 3D grid defined as the vertical difference between
%                 the centroids of the top and bottom surfaces of each
%                 cell (faces labelled 5 and 6).
%
%     - z      -- A G.cells.num-by-1 array of the z-component of the
%                 centroid of the bottom surface of each cell, defined
%                 relative to the height of the centroid of the top
%                 surface, i.e., a column-wise cumsum of columns.dz.
%
%
%   CELLS - Cell structure Gt.cells, as described by grid_structure
%   but with the extra fields:
%
%     - columnPos -- Indirection map of size [num+1,1] into the
%                  'columns.cells' array. Specifically, the cells in the
%                  column of the 3D grid corresponding to cell 'i' in the
%                  top-surface grid are found in the submatrix
%
%                    Gt.columns.cells(columnPos(i):columnPos(i+1)-1,:)
%
%                  The number of cells in the each column can be computed
%                  by the statement DIFF(columnPos)
%
%     - map3DFace -- A cells.num-by-1 array that maps between a cell in the
%                  top-surface grid and the corresponding top face in the
%                  underlying 3D grid, i.e., cell 'i' corresponds to face
%                  number Gt.cells.map3DFace(i).
%
%     - ij      -- A map of size [num,1] giving logical indices of the
%                  cells in the top-surface grid
%
%     - H       -- A  array of formation heights, one for each cell
%
%     - normals -- normal vector of the surface represented by each cell
%
%     - z       -- A cells.num-by-1 array of the third coordinate of the
%                  cell centroids in R^3. The first two coordinates are
%                  given in Gt.cells.
%
%
%   FACES - Cell structure Gt.faces, as described in grid_structure
%   but with the following extra field created by a subsequent call to
%   computeGeometryVE:
%
%     - z       -- A faces.num-by-1 array of the third coordinate of the
%                  face centroids in R^3. The first two coordinates are
%                  given in Gt.faces.centroids.
%
%
%   NODES - Cell structure Gt.nodes, as described in grid_structure
%   but with the following extra field created by a subsequent call to
%   computeGeometryVE:
%
%     - z       -- A nodes.num-by-1 array of the third coordinate of the
%                  node positions in R^3, i.e., the z-coordinate of the
%                  top surface of the original grid. The first two
%                  coordinates are given in Gt.nodes.coords.
%
%
% COMMENTS:
%   PLEASE NOTE:
%   The current implementation does not honour faults and internal
%   boundaries from 3D grid, i.e., it is possible to get false connections
%   over faults if there is no jump in the ij index over the fault in the
%   3D grid.
