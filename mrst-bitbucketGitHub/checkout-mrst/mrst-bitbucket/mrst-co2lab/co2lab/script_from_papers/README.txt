The directories contain MATLAB code that can be used with co2lab to generate the
examples within.  Minor discrepancies may occur as a side effect of later code
maintenance.

In some of the paper directories, there is a Matlab script called
'runAllExamples_paperX'. This script documents the exact calls to other scripts
and functions used to generate the diagrams/graphs of each specific figure in
that paper. The script is thus not intended to be run through from beginning to
end, but to document how each specific figure is generated.

(*) - Some of the scripts for this paper are planned to be made available in a 
      future release.
