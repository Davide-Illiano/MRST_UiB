* Stuff to do
** INMIND Last attempt to fix last example of paper2
- can this be made to run if we change timestep size?
** DONE Finish off code for paper3 (at least what there is time for)
- last example needs to be tested
** DONE Tidy up code
*** DONE Go through co2lab-ad, reorganise (move to deprecated or elsewhere)
*** DONE Placement of the new code in appropriate places
*** CANCELED +Write READMEs for all the papers+
Not necessary, as there is a common README script for them all.
*** DONE What to do about the file dsxy2figxy_new ?
*** DONE Document new code
**** DONE Decide how to deal with the CO2 object, CoolProps and data files
**** DONE Code that needs documentation:
***** DONE runStandardModel
***** DONE getPhaseFluxAndProps_WGVE
***** DONE CO2VEBlackOilTypeModel
***** DONE SampledProp2D
***** DONE CO2props  (add documentation of default ranges!)
***** DONE boCO2
***** DONE runAllExamples_paper1
***** DONE runAllExamples_paper2
***** DONE runAllExamples_paper3
***** DONE generatePropsTable
***** DONE addSampledFluidProperties
***** DONE makeVEFluid
*** DONE Delint
*** DONE Run script to remove all trailing whitespace from all m-files
*** DONE Address all @@
** Run through all examples once more
*** Verify that scripts run even when clear all has been called first, and that all modules are loaded when necessary
*** List of all examples expected to be working
