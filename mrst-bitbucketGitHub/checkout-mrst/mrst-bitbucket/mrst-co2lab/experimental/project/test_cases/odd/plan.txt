* establishing fundamental data
  * load IGEMS data surface, and create associated rock structure
  * create top grid and 2D rock structure
  * visualize/explain top surface
* trapping analysis
  * view all traps
  * view all spill regions
  * view trap connections
  * statistics on trap volumes
  * compute total resulting trapping for an arbitrary grid cell (interactive?)
* simulation
  * put a well the grid cell just analyzed, and inject enough to make it overflow the first encoutnered trap
      * compare different injection rates
