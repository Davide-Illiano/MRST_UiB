%% Read and prepare grid structure

% 'readGRDECL' reads this file and produce a MATLAB data structure
% representing the grid on this format.  The grid is then converted to the
% MRST grid structure using the 'processGRDECL' command, and useful
% geometry information is computed explicitly in the call to
% 'computeGeometry'.  Finally, the top surface of the 3D grid is extracted
% as a 2D grid with the 'topSurfaceGrid' function.

% To illustrate the 3D grid and the extracted 2D grid, we plot them on the
% same figure.  For convenience, we shift the plot of the extracted top
% grid fifty meters upwards.  This way, the plots will not overlap and we
% will clearly see the extracted 2D surface as distinct from the 3D grid.
% As we can see from the resulting graphic, the top surface is gently
% sloping, slighly curved, and contains elongated local irregularities that
% runs perpendicular to the direction of the slope.  In addition, there are
% several discontinuities from faults.  Assuming that the top surface
% represents a boundary with an inpermeable caprock above, the geometric
% irregularity will provide a certain capacity of structural trapping of
% CO2 (local 'pockets' where the CO2, flowing upward, would be stuck).
% 
% The next section will present a geometric analyisis of this structural
% trapping capacity.

%% First study: geometric analyisis of caprock (spill point analysis)
% The following command carries out a structural trapping analysis based on
% the geometry of the top surface.  It identifies _all traps_ (local
% pockets), along with their _depth_ (at which they 'spill over'),
% _connections_ (i.e., when a trap spills over, which trap(s) does the CO2
% flow into next), as well as the _rivers along which CO2 flows between
% traps_.  In addition, each cell in the top surface grid is associated
% with an unique _spill region_ associated with a trap (or with the
% exterior).  A spill region of a given trap consists of all the cells in
% the grid that 'leads into' the trap; in other words, it consists of all
% the cells from which a quantity of CO2 would eventually flow into the
% trap.

ts = trapAnalysis(Gt, false); % 'true' runs a cell-based algorithm for analysis;
                              % 'false' a node-based one (but result still
                              % presented for cells, not nodes).

%%
% The resulting structure contains the following fields:
ts %#ok

%% 
% |ts.traps| associates an integer to each cell of the top grid.  For cells
% located _within_ a trap, the integer will be the index of that trap.  For
% other cells, the integer will be a zero.  Traps are indexed from 1 and
% upwards. The total number of traps would thus be given by:
num_traps = max(ts.traps) %#ok

%%
% In order to have an idea about the location and distribution of traps, we
% can plot the trap cells on the grid by generating a scalar field over the
% grid cells, with two possible values ('trap-cell' and 'non-trap-cell')
% and then call the 'plotCellData' command.  On the resulting plot, we can
% see several long-narrow traps aligned with the crests of the surface, as
% well as a large number of scattered, small pockets.

trap_field = zeros(size(ts.traps));
trap_field(ts.traps>0) = 2;
figure(1); clf; 
plotCellData(Gt, trap_field, plot_opts{:});
view(30,20); colormap('jet');

%%
% Likewise, the 'rivers' exiting each trap (and then either entering
% another trap or exiting the domain) are stored in |ts.cell_lines|.  We
% can visualise them together with the traps by making a separate scalar
% field for rivers:

river_field = zeros(size(ts.traps));
for r = [ts.cell_lines{:}]'
    for c = 1:numel(r);
        river_field(r{c}) = 1;

%% 
% The vector |ts.trap_z| contains the _spill point depth_ for each trap,
% i.e., the depth at which the trap 'spills over'.  The trapping capacity
% of a trap is thus limited to the volume between the top of the grid
% within that trap and the plane defined by z equal to the spill point
% depth of that trap.  (In addition, one would have to multiply by the rock
% porosity, since the storage volume is limited to the pore volume.)
% 
% With |ts.traps|, |ts.trap_z| and the porosity values from our averaged
% rock structure, we can now easily compute the storage volumes for each
% trap.

trap_volumes = volumesOfTraps(Gt, ts, 1:num_traps, 'poro',rock2D.poro);

total_trapping_capacity = sum(trap_volumes);
fprintf('Total trapping capacity is: %6.2e\n\n', total_trapping_capacity);

%%
% We can get some information on the 10 largest traps of the grid:
[sorted_vols, sorted_ix] = sort(trap_volumes, 'descend');

fprintf('trap ix   | trap vol(m3)  | cells in trap\n');
fprintf('----------+---------------+--------------\n');
for i = 1:10
   fprintf('%7d   |  %10.3e   | %5d\n', ...
       sorted_ix(i), sorted_vols(i), numel(find(ts.traps == sorted_ix(i))));
end
fprintf(['\nTogether, these traps cover %6.2e m3, which represents %3.1f ' ...
   'percent of\nthe total trapping capacity of this grid.\n'], ...
   sum(sorted_vols(1:10)), sum(sorted_vols(1:10)) / total_trapping_capacity * 100)

%%
% Now, we visualise the location of these 10 traps (plotted in red, against
% the remaining traps in yellow):
largest_traps_field = zeros(size(ts.traps));
largest_traps_field(ismember(ts.traps, sorted_ix(1:10))) = 3;
clf; plotCellData(Gt, max(trap_field, largest_traps_field), plot_opts{:});
view(12,60);

%%
% We can also color code each trap according to the total volume it holds:
for i = 1:num_traps
    trap_field(ts.traps == i) = trap_volumes(i);
end
clf; plotCellData(Gt, trap_field, plot_opts{:}); colorbar;


%%
% Each trap has an associated _accumulation region_, which consists of all
% cells 'spilling into' that trap.  In other words, injection of a quantity
% of CO2 into one of these cells would, assuming a purely gravity-driven
% flow, lead it to flow into the trap.  If we also count all cells leading
% _out_ of the grid as a separate accumulation region, then any grid cell
% belongs to exactly one accumulation region (either into a specific trap
% or out of the domain.
%
% The accumulation region a cell belongs to is given by |ts.trap_regions|.
% There is one integer value per cell, either indicating the index of the
% corresponding trap, or '0' if it belongs to the accumulation region that
% leads out of the grid domain.  We can visualize these regions by plotting
% them as a field on the grid, and use a colormap with sharp variations in
% color:

clf; plotCellData(Gt, ts.trap_regions, plot_opts{:});
colormap(colorcube(max(ts.trap_regions)+1)); view(54,26);
