function varargout = checkBGL()
%Checks if matlab boost graph library is installed.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   hasBGL = checkBGL();
%   checkBGL();
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   This function checks if MatlabBGL
%   (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/10922) is
%   installed and advises the user to install it if it is not found.
%
%   If called with a return argument, it will produce a boolean indicating
%   the status of the BGL library. The application checking for BGL can
%   then fall back to other implementations of graph algorithms as they
%   please. If called without any return arguments, it will throw an error
%   if BGL was not found, along with a link and install instructions for
%   the user to rectify the missing installation.
%
%
% RETURNS:
%   foundBGL (OPTIONAL) - If BGL was found. Note that the nature of the
%                         utility changes if called with return argument.
