function [fill_heights, sat_field, escaped_vol] = ...
    computeTrappedDistribution(Gt, tstruct, cell_ix, vol, poro)
% 
% Compute the final distribution of an injected quantity of CO2, only taking
% topography/structural trapping into account, and assuming infinitely slow flow.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   function [fill_heights, hfield, escaped_vol] =  
%      computeTrappedDistribution(Gt, tstruct, cell_ix, vol, poro)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   Gt      - top surface grid
%   tstruct - trapping structure for 'Gt', as computed by 'trapAnalysis'
%   cell_ix - index of the cell into which CO2 is injected
%   vol     - volume of injected CO2
%   poro    - porosity of each cell in 'Gt'.
%
% RETURNS:
%   fill_heights - one value per trap in the grid.  Expressing to which
%                  z-height each trap has been filled.  A zero value means
%                  that this trap has gone untouched.
%   sat_field    - saturation field (one value per cell)
%   escaped_vol  - the amount of injected volume that has not been trapped
%                  (i.e. that has 'escaped')
%

% SEE ALSO:
% `trapAnalysis`

  num_traps = numel(tstruct.trap_z);
  fill_heights = zeros(num_traps, 1); % initially, no trap has received any CO2

  escaped_vol = vol; % Initially assume that all injected volume will escape
  sat_field = zeros(Gt.cells.num, 1);
  
  start_trap = tstruct.trap_regions(cell_ix);
  if start_trap == 0 
      % cell does not belong to any interior trap spill region.  All injected
      % fluid escapes
      return;
  end
  
  % Computing the traps involved and their degree of fill
  [fill_heights, escaped_vol] = ...
      distribute_downwards(Gt, tstruct, start_trap, vol, poro, fill_heights);
  
  % Finally, computing the saturation field
  for t_ix = find(fill_heights > 0)'
      h = fill_heights(t_ix);
      cixs = find(tstruct.traps == t_ix);
      sat = Gt.cells.volumes(cixs) .* (h - Gt.cells.z(cixs)) ./ Gt.cells.H(cixs);
      sat = max(0, sat); % eliminates cells positioned higher than 'h'
      sat_field(cixs) = sat;
