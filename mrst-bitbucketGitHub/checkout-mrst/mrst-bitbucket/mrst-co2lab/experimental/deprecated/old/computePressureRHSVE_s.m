function [ff, gg, hh, gp, dF, dC] = computePressureRHSVE_s(g, omega, bc, src, varargin)
%Compute right-hand side contributions to pressure linear system for VE-s.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [f, g, h, grav, dF, dC] = computePressureRHS_s(G, omega, bc, src)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   The contributions to the right-hand side for mimetic, two-point and
%   multi-point discretisations of the equations for pressure and total
%   velocity 
%                     
%     v + lam K·grad (p - g·z omega) = 0
%     div v  = q 
%
%   with  
%             __
%             \    kr_i/
%     lam   = /       / mu_i 
%             -- i
%             __
%             \
%     omega = /    f_i·rho_i
%             -- i
%              
% PARAMETERS:
%   G     - Grid data structure.
%
%   omega - Accumulated phase densities \rho_i weighted by fractional flow
%           functions f_i -- i.e., omega = \sum_i \rho_i f_i.  One scalar
%           value for each cell in the discretised reservoir model, G.
%
%   bc    - Boundary condition structure as defined by function 'addBC'.
%           This structure accounts for all external boundary conditions to
%           the reservoir flow.  May be empty (i.e., bc = struct([])) which
%           is interpreted as all external no-flow (homogeneous Neumann)
%           conditions.
%
%   src   - Explicit source contributions as defined by function
%           'addSource'.  May be empty (i.e., src = struct([])) which is
%           interpreted as a reservoir model without explicit sources.
%
% RETURNS:
%   f, g, h - Pressure (f), source/sink (g), and flux (h) external
%             conditions.  In a problem without effects of gravity, these
%             values may be passed directly on to linear system solvers
%             such as 'schurComplementSymm'.
%
%   grav    - Pressure contributions from gravity,
%
%                grav = omega·g·(x_face - x_cell)
%
%             where 
%
%                omega = \sum_i f_i\rho_i,
%
%             thus grav is a vector with one scalar value for each
%             half-face in the model (size(G.cells.faces,1)).
%
%   dF, dC  - Packed Dirichlet/pressure condition structure.  The faces in
%             'dF' and the values in 'dC'.  May be used to eliminate known
%             face pressures from the linear system before calling a system
%             solver (e.g., 'schurComplementSymm').
