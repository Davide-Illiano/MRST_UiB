classdef ImplicitExplicitOilWaterSurfactantModel < OilWaterSurfactantBaseModel
%
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   model = ImplicitExplicitOilWaterSurfactantModel(G, rock, fluid, varargin)
%
% DESCRIPTION: Implicit-explicit model for a oil water system with
% surfactant. The implicit step consists of solving the oil-water system
% implicitly with a fixed concentration of surfactant. Then, the transport
% equation for the surfactant are solved explicitly, for fixed pressure and
% saturation. A description of the surfactant model that is implemented can be
% found in ad-eor/docs directory.
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   G        - Grid
%   rock     - Rock structure
%   fluid    - Fluid structure
%   varargin - optional parameter
%
% RETURNS:
%   class instance
