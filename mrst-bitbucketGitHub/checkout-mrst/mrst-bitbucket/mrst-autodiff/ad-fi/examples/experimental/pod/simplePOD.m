%% Reservoir simulation using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)
% This example demonstrates the use of model reduction when solving a given
% system for many small variations of the same schedule. The example is
% meant to illustrate the principles, not best practice for real cases.

%% Setup
% Load required modules and set random stream
mrstModule add deckformat ad-core ad-props ad-fi

s = RandStream('mcg16807', 'Seed', 0);
try
   s0 = RandStream.setGlobalStream(s);
catch %#ok
   s0 = RandStream.setDefaultStream(s);  %#ok Backwards compatibility
end

%% Create basis for proper orthogonal decomposition
% When doing model reduction, parts of the model can be reduced based on
% the assumption that the eigenspace of the simulation is similar to the
% eigenspace of the history we are using to construct the basis. As the
% pressure solution is costly and in general very smooth, we opt to
% reduce the pressure variable. This is done by a singular value
% decomposition and then using the largest eigenvalues to find the
% eigenvalues which capture the most essential patterns of pressure.
%
% We reduce the number of pressure variables from 900 to 25. Saturation is
% more difficult to reduce accurately, requiring a magnitude more variables
% and clustering of eigenvectors. This example defaults to no clustering as
% the implementation of clustering depends on an external package YAEL

%% Run another schedule both using pod and a full solution
% The schedule is the same in terms of well setup, grid,
% porosity/permeability as well as the general flow pattern, but the rates
% have been changed. This is typical of an optimization loop: Several
% similar configurations which share many properties will be solved, either
% manually by a reservoir engineer or by a automated optimization program.
%
% In general, a model reduction will not converge fully. We simply limit
% the number of iterations. A more sophisticated approach would involve
% setting the convergence limits based on the amount of reduction done.
