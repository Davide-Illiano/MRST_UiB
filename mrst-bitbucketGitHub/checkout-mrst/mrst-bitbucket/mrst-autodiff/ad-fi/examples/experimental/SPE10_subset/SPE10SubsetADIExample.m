%% Simulate a large example using parts of SPE10
% This example is a larger example demonstrating the solver on a medium
% size grid (66,000 cells) with a relatively large amount of time steps
% (100). This example will take some time, especially if MLDIVIDE is used
% as the elliptic solver. Be wary that increasing the number of layers may
% let the simulations take a very long time.
%
% Furthermore, note that the 'solvefiADI' solver and especially the CPR
% preconditioner, uses direct indexing into sparse matrices.  In MATLABs
% prior to release R2011a, this is relatively inefficient.  Starting from
% 2011a however, the bottleneck of direct indexing has been largely
% removed.

% corresponding cells.

% Set up a Water / Oil system using CPR preconditioner. Alternatively we
% could have used a specialized elliptic solver using the option 'cprEllipticSolver'
% to exploit the nature of the variables involving pressure.

system = initADISystem({'Water', 'Oil'}, G, rock, fluid, 'cpr', true, 'cprRelTol', 2e-2);
% If an alternative solver for the pressure subproblem was installed, it
% could be added using
%
%    system.nonlinear.cprEllipticSolver = @(A,b) solver(A,b)
%
% This can greatly speed up the solution process, as the default option
% uses MATLABs direct solver @mldivide which is very expensive for a
% preconditioner.

%% Simulate 1000 days of production and save iteration count and time
% We provide the solver with time steps for roughly 1000 days of
% production. A few smaller steps are done to get better accuracy during
% the initial injection period. After this we do 10 day intervals to step
% rapidly through the schedule. While this converges at every time step,
% implicit solvers will still get improved accuracy by doing smaller time
% steps. Numerical diffusion can, for instance, be problematic when doing
% large time steps.
