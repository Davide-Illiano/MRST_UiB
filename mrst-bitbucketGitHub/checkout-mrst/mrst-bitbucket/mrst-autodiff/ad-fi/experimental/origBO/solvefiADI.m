function [state, its] = solvefiADI(state0, dt, W, G, system)
% Solve a automatic differentiation system for a single timestep.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   state = solvefiADI(state, dt, W, G);
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   state0 - Initial state as defined by initResSol
%
%   dt     - Size of timestep.
%
%   W      - Well configuration. Must have valid sign for all producers and
%            injectors.
%
%   G      - Grid. See grid_structure.
%
%   system - Valid system as defined by initADISystem. This function
%            defines all options for convergence, how to set up equations
%            and parameters for the non-linear solver.
%
% RETURNS:
%   state  - Updated state after convergence or max iterations being reached.
%
% COMMENTS:
%
%   The fully implicit AD solvers are written to minimize duplication of
%   coding effort. Primarly, this consists of a splitting of general logic
%   for solving schedules and timesteps and the setup of equations and
%   their solution. In general, a system is created which defines the
%   phases present along with handles to the stepFunction for that specific
%   type of system.
%
%   When solving for a single timestep, the stepFunction is called until
%   the stepFunction reports convergence or stopping in the meta struct it
%   returns.
%
%   The step functions can be completely arbitrary, but for the current
%   solvers the general structure are:
%
%    - solvefiADI calls stepFunction
%    - The stepFunction calls eqsfi<systemtype>, solves a single Newton
%    step to accuracies defined by the system input using some kind of
%    linear solver (Direct solver / some CPR preconditioner configuration)
%    and then updates the state.
%    - solvefiADI checks wells and returns the final state.
%
%   Depending on the simulation, solvefiADI may be exposed directly in a
%   for loop or hidden within a wrapper such as runScheduleADI.
