function [cg neighbors] = addVirtualCG(cg, neighbors, vmod)
% Add virtual cells to a coarse grid
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   addVirtualCG(cg, neighbors)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   cg        - coarse grid as defined by generateCoarseGrid(G, p)
%   neighbors - a cell array where cell i contains indices of the coarse
%               neighbors of coarse block i
%
%  RETURNS:
%   cg        - coarse grid with additional fields:
%                   - is_virtual containing bools indicating if a cell is
%                     virtual or not.
%                   - updated cells.num and cell.centroids for the new
%                   virtual blocks. The virtual blocks are not fully
%                   defined.
%   neighbors - updated neighbor structure, where virtual blocks are
%               neighbors to their parent (some coarse block on the edge)
%               as well as the virtual nodes grown from the neighbors of
%               the parent.
